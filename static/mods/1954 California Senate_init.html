Before becoming a Representative, he was a state Representative. Yorty had previously tried for the Senate in 1940, but lost badly in the primary to incumbent Republican Hiram Johnson. He then served in World War 2 before returning to the state assembly.<br><br> So far he has positioned himself as a liberal Democrat. He supported state ownership of public utilities, labor unions, and sided with the Spanish Republicans during the Spanish Civil War. However, this led to the Communist Party to support him and he was labeled a member of the party and a communist. Thankfully, these allegations were quickly disproven, so Yorty's reputation remains intact. Still, the whole fiasco has caused Yorty to perhaps rethink his political beliefs to better suit him.\n<br><br>Regardless, Yorty has once again sought the Senate again and he is in a more favorable position. The McCarthy Hearings has given him momentum to a close race, but it won't guarantee him a victory. His opponent, Kuchel, has kept himself away from the backlash and presented himself as a moderate and even has similar positions to Yorty. If Yorty wants to win this, he must define the election and himself.",
