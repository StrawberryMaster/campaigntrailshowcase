Like the rest of the KKK, it was strongly white supremacist against African Americans, Chinese Americans, and also Catholics and Jews, whose faiths were commonly associated with Irish, Italian, Balkan, and Slavic immigrants and their descendants</p><p>The Indiana Klan rose to prominence beginning in the early 1920s after World War I, when white Protestants felt threatened by social and political issues, including changes caused by decades of immigration from southern and eastern Europe. Indiana's Klan was one of the strongest in the country, with a large percentage of the entire White Protestant male population being members.</p><p>.......</p><h4>Peak of Influence and Downfall</h4><p>At the height of its power, the Klan had over 250,000 members. The highest concentration was in cities in the central part of the state. Klan membership was discouraged in some parts of the state; in New Albany, for instance, city leaders denounced the Klan and discouraged residents from joining. Other cities, including Indianapolis, were almost completely controlled by the Klan, and election to public office was impossible without their support.</p><p>However - the nomination of Indiana Senator Samuel Ralston by the Democratic Party in the <u>1924 Presidential Election</u> ironically helped contribute to the organization's downfall. While Ralston never made any public declarations in support of the Klan, his ties lingered on the national stage as he campaigned. When the election became deadlocked - the first time since 1824, these ties made many reluctant to allow him to come to power, and thus, Coolidge was easily re-elected in the ensuing contingent election.</p>`)

Gatsby is known for his extravagant parties, but his true goal is to reunite with his lost love, Daisy Buchanan.

Welcome to Astro's Variable Headquarters
This is a fairly simple function you can add to your mods. It will create a little menu in which the player can view the numbers laid out within the functions.
This is a great way to give the player a little more information about your mod.

Across this code, you will find a lot of aspects you can edit. I have left plenty of comments to help you understand what each part does.
Don't be afraid to ask in #mod-help on the Discord for clarification or help with editing this code.

To use this, place this code below your Code 2, and edit it as needed. You can duplicate the 'let a = document.createElement('p');' section to add more lines of text.

Functions are referenced in text like so: ' + function + '. This will display the number from the function in the text.
Credit to Nina, who made the original code that summoned the new screen (originally for the 1960Red/1952Blue advisor screen)
Go ahead and use this code in your mods - just give me credit. I hope it helps you out!
